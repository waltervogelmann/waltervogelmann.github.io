It seems obvious, but how strong is that relationship? In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to answer questions like this using Python, pandas, and matplotlib.\nWe’ll work through a complete workflow: - Loading and inspecting player statistics - Cleaning messy data - Creating a professional scatterplot - Adding a regression line to quantify the relationship\nBy the end, you’ll have a reusable template for exploring correlations in any sport or dataset.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let’s load our basketball statistics and take a quick look at what we’re working with.\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('player_stats.csv')\n\n# Display first few rows\nprint(df.head())\nHere’s what our dataset looks like:\n\n\n\nPlayer\nMinutes\nPoints\nRebounds\n\n\n\n\nLeBron James\n35.2\n27.1\n7.5\n\n\nStephen Curry\n34.3\n29.4\n5.2\n\n\nKevin Durant\n36.9\n29.7\n7.1\n\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo\n32.8\n31.1\n11.6\n\n\nJoel Embiid\n33.1\n33.1\n10.2\n\n\n\nEach row represents a player’s per-game averages for the season.\n\n\n\n\nReal-world data is rarely perfect.

    "text": "Every baseball fan has heard the mantra: “Get ahead in the count.” Pitching coaches preach it, announcers repeat it, and players live by it. But how much does that first pitch actually matter? Is starting an at-bat 0-1 versus 1-0 just conventional wisdom, or is there real data to back up the psychological advantage?\nAs someone who’s spent countless hours watching baseball, I’ve always been curious about the mental chess match between pitcher and batter. That first pitch sets the tone for everything that follows—but I wanted to move beyond intuition and quantify exactly how outcomes differ based on whether pitchers throw a strike or ball on pitch number one.\n\n\n\nMy research question: How do at-bat outcomes differ when pitchers throw a strike versus a ball on the first pitch, controlling for batter aggression?\nThis question matters because it gets at the heart of in-game strategy. Should aggressive batters swing at the first pitch? Do passive batters benefit more from getting ahead in the count? Understanding these dynamics could inform coaching decisions and help us appreciate the subtle psychology playing out in every plate appearance.\n\n\n\nBefore diving into web scraping, I needed to ensure my data collection was both ethical and legal. MLB’s Statcast system provides incredibly detailed pitch-by-pitch data, and their copyright policy explicitly permits individual, non-commercial use of this data—perfect for academic projects like this one.\nI used the pybaseball Python library, which serves as an approved wrapper for MLB’s publicly available Statcast API. No API key is required, and the library includes built-in rate limiting and caching to be respectful of MLB’s servers. This approach follows best practices for ethical data collection:\n\nPublic data source: Statcast data is publicly accessible\nRate limiting: Automatic delays between requests prevent server overload\nTerms compliance: Non-commercial academic use is explicitly allowed\nAttribution: All data properly credited to MLB Advanced Media\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to explore MLB data for your own project, here’s the streamlined process:\n\n\npip install pybaseball pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy\n\n\n\nfrom pybaseball import statcast, cache\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Enable caching to speed up repeated queries\ncache.enable()\n\n# Collect pitch-by-pitch data for 2024 season\ndata = statcast(start_dt='2024-04-01', end_dt='2024-09-30')\nThis single function call retrieves every pitch thrown during the specified time period, including detailed information about location, velocity, spin rate, and outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe beauty of Statcast data is that each pitch includes a pitch_number field that tells you its position in the at-bat:\nfirst_pitches = data[data['pitch_number'] == 1].copy()\n\n\n\nThe most challenging part was calculating batter aggression metrics. I created three key variables to control for batter tendencies:\n\nOverall swing rate: Percentage of all pitches a batter swings at\nChase rate: Percentage of pitches outside the strike zone a batter swings at\nFirst-pitch swing rate: How often a batter swings at the first pitch\n\nThese metrics required grouping the full dataset by batter and analyzing their behavior across all at-bats, then merging these calculated features back to the first-pitch data.\n\n\n\nOne tricky aspect: the at-bat outcome (hit, out, walk, etc.) only appears on the final pitch of each plate appearance. I had to merge first-pitch data with final outcomes using game identifiers and at-bat numbers to connect each first pitch with how the entire at-bat concluded.\nKey tip for similar projects: Start with a small date range (like one week) to test your code before scaling up to an entire season. The full season took about 10 minutes to download and process.\n\n\n\n\nMy final dataset contains 178,604 at-bats from the 2024 MLB season, representing every first pitch thrown between April 1 and September 30. Here’s what makes this dataset rich for analysis:\n\n651 unique batters and 853 unique pitchers\n20+ variables including pitch type, location, velocity, movement, game context, and batter characteristics\nMultiple outcome categories: Hits, outs, walks, strikeouts, and others\n\n\n\nPitchers threw a first-pitch strike 62.3% of the time—more often than I expected! This suggests that getting ahead in the count is indeed a strategic priority across the league.\n\n\n\nHere’s where it gets interesting. When I compared at-bat outcomes based on that crucial first pitch:\nAfter a first-pitch STRIKE: - Hit rate: 22.2% - Strikeout rate: 24.9% - Walk rate: 5.0%\nAfter a first-pitch BALL: - Hit rate: 21.1% - Strikeout rate: 18.5% - Walk rate: 16.3%\nThe difference is striking. Pitchers record a strikeout 6.4 percentage points more often (24.9% vs 18.5%) when they start with a first-pitch strike—a 35% relative increase. Even more dramatic: batters are more than three times as likely to draw a walk when they get ahead 1-0 (16.3%) compared to falling behind 0-1 (5.0%).\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most fascinating finding came when I segmented batters by their first-pitch swing rate:\n\nPassive batters (low first-pitch swing rate): 28% swing rate on first pitches\nAggressive batters (high first-pitch swing rate): 42% swing rate on first pitches\n\nThe impact of first-pitch strikes varied by batter type, suggesting that the psychological advantage isn’t uniform—it depends on the individual matchup. Aggressive batters who swing at the first pitch might neutralize the pitcher’s advantage, while passive batters who take pitches feel more pressure after falling behind.\n\n\n\nI ran a chi-square test to determine if the relationship between first-pitch outcome and at-bat result was statistically significant. The result? A p-value far below 0.05, confirming that first-pitch outcomes are strongly associated with how at-bats end, even after accounting for batter tendencies.\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset opens up numerous avenues for deeper analysis:\n\nDo certain pitch types (fastball vs. breaking ball) work better as first pitches?\nHow does pitch location affect outcomes?\nAre there times in the game (late innings, high-leverage situations) where first-pitch strikes matter even more?\n\nThe data is rich enough to explore all of these questions and more.\n\n\n\nWant to explore this data yourself or build something similar? Here are the key resources:\n\nPyBaseball Documentation - The Python library I used\nMLB Statcast Search - Explore the data visually\nMy GitHub Repository - Complete code and dataset\n\nThe repository includes: - mlb_first_pitch_data_collection_and_eda.py - Full data collection script & Exploratory data analysis - mlb_first_pitch_data_2024.csv - The complete dataset (if under GitHub’s size limit) - Visualization images generated from the analysis\n\n\n\nWhat started as curiosity about baseball wisdom turned into a data science project that confirmed what coaches have known intuitively: getting ahead in the count matters—a lot. But the data also revealed nuance in how much it matters and for whom, highlighting the complex psychological dynamics at play in America’s pastime.\nThe beauty of working with sports data is that every at-bat tells a story, and when you aggregate 178,604 stories, clear patterns emerge. Whether you’re a baseball fan, a statistics enthusiast, or someone looking for an interesting data project, I hope this inspires you to explore the treasure trove of publicly available sports data.\nNow if you’ll excuse me, I have about 178,000 more at-bats to analyze.",

    "text": "If you want to explore MLB data for your own project, here’s the streamlined process:\n\n\npip install pybaseball pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy\n\n\n\nfrom pybaseball import statcast, cache\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Enable caching to speed up repeated queries\ncache.enable()\n\n# Collect pitch-by-pitch data for 2024 season\ndata = statcast(start_dt='2024-04-01', end_dt='2024-09-30')\nThis single function call retrieves every pitch thrown during the specified time period, including detailed information about location, velocity, spin rate, and outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe beauty of Statcast data is that each pitch includes a pitch_number field that tells you its position in the at-bat:\nfirst_pitches = data[data['pitch_number'] == 1].copy()\n\n\n\nThe most challenging part was calculating batter aggression metrics. I created three key variables to control for batter tendencies:\n\nOverall swing rate: Percentage of all pitches a batter swings at\nChase rate: Percentage of pitches outside the strike zone a batter swings at\nFirst-pitch swing rate: How often a batter swings at the first pitch\n\nThese metrics required grouping the full dataset by batter and analyzing their behavior across all at-bats, then merging these calculated features back to the first-pitch data.\n\n\n\nOne tricky aspect: the at-bat outcome (hit, out, walk, etc.) only appears on the final pitch of each plate appearance. I had to merge first-pitch data with final outcomes using game identifiers and at-bat numbers to connect each first pitch with how the entire at-bat concluded.\nKey tip for similar projects: Start with a small date range (like one week) to test your code before scaling up to an entire season. The full season took about 10 minutes to download and process.",

    "text": "My final dataset contains 178,604 at-bats from the 2024 MLB season, representing every first pitch thrown between April 1 and September 30. Here’s what makes this dataset rich for analysis:\n\n651 unique batters and 853 unique pitchers\n20+ variables including pitch type, location, velocity, movement, game context, and batter characteristics\nMultiple outcome categories: Hits, outs, walks, strikeouts, and others\n\n\n\nPitchers threw a first-pitch strike 62.3% of the time—more often than I expected! This suggests that getting ahead in the count is indeed a strategic priority across the league.\n\n\n\nHere’s where it gets interesting. When I compared at-bat outcomes based on that crucial first pitch:\nAfter a first-pitch STRIKE: - Hit rate: 22.2% - Strikeout rate: 24.9% - Walk rate: 5.0%\nAfter a first-pitch BALL: - Hit rate: 21.1% - Strikeout rate: 18.5% - Walk rate: 16.3%\nThe difference is striking. Pitchers record a strikeout 6.4 percentage points more often (24.9% vs 18.5%) when they start with a first-pitch strike—a 35% relative increase. Even more dramatic: batters are more than three times as likely to draw a walk when they get ahead 1-0 (16.3%) compared to falling behind 0-1 (5.0%).\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most fascinating finding came when I segmented batters by their first-pitch swing rate:\n\nPassive batters (low first-pitch swing rate): 28% swing rate on first pitches\nAggressive batters (high first-pitch swing rate): 42% swing rate on first pitches\n\nThe impact of first-pitch strikes varied by batter type, suggesting that the psychological advantage isn’t uniform—it depends on the individual matchup. Aggressive batters who swing at the first pitch might neutralize the pitcher’s advantage, while passive batters who take pitches feel more pressure after falling behind.\n\n\n\nI ran a chi-square test to determine if the relationship between first-pitch outcome and at-bat result was statistically significant. The result? A p-value far below 0.05, confirming that first-pitch outcomes are strongly associated with how at-bats end, even after accounting for batter tendencies.",
