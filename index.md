# Hello! I'm [Your Name] 👋

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This site shows my journey learning data science and analytics. Here you'll find projects that demonstrate what I've learned and discovered.

## 🎓 About This Portfolio

This portfolio shows my work learning data science. Each project includes:

- My code with documentation
- Visualizations I created
- What I learned and discovered

I built this site using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## 🛠️ Skills I'm Learning

- **Programming**: Python, Pandas for data analysis
- **Visualization**: Creating charts with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- **Data Collection**: Getting data from files, websites, and APIs
- **Analysis**: Finding patterns and answering questions with data
